# React + Vite

This project is a boilerplate setup for building modern React applications with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).  
It is designed to be minimal, fast, and developer-friendly, while still providing a solid foundation for scaling into larger projects.

Vite is a next-generation frontend tooling that offers lightning-fast hot module replacement (HMR), optimized builds, and an easy integration with modern frameworks like React. Combined with React, it makes for a powerful stack for building performant and scalable web applications.
