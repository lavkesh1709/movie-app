# React + Vite

This project is a boilerplate setup for building modern React applications with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/). It is designed to be minimal, fast, and developer-friendly, while still providing a solid foundation for scaling into larger projects.

Vite is a next-generation frontend tooling that offers lightning-fast hot module replacement (HMR), optimized builds, and an easy integration with modern frameworks like React. Combined with React, it makes for a powerful stack for building performant and scalable web applications.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally.

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd <your-project-folder>
npm install
npm run dev
npm run build
npm run preview

Available Scripts

npm run dev – Starts the development server.
npm run build – Builds the application for production.
npm run preview – Previews the built application locally.
npm run lint – Runs ESLint to check for code style issues.

Tech Stack

React
 – Component-based UI library.
Vite
 – Next-generation frontend build tool.
ESLint
 – JavaScript/React linting for consistent code.
Node.js
 – Runtime environment for executing JavaScript.

Development Workflow

Write code inside the src directory.
Create reusable components in src/components.
For navigation, add page-level components under src/pages.
Use npm run lint before committing to ensure code quality.
Run npm run build before deployment.

Linting and Code Quality

This project uses ESLint to maintain consistent code quality.
To run lint checks manually:
npm run lint

Expanding with TypeScript

If you want to use TypeScript, you can start from the official React + TypeScript Vite template
.

This provides:

Type-aware lint rules.
Better IDE support.
Safer code with static type checking.
To migrate an existing project, install TypeScript and related dependencies:

npm install -D typescript @types/react @types/react-dom

Best Practices

Keep components small and reusable.
Organize code logically in components and pages directories.
Use environment variables (.env files) for API keys and configuration.
Run npm run lint regularly to catch issues early.
Commit changes frequently with meaningful commit messages.

Contributions are welcome!
Fork the repository.

Create a new feature branch (git checkout -b feature-branch).
Make your changes and commit (git commit -m "Add new feature").
Push to the branch (git push origin feature-branch).
Open a Pull Request.
